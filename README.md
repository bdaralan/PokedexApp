# PokedexApp
iOS Pokedex App

## Another version of [PokemonApp](https://github.com/iDara09/PokemonApp)
The [PokemonApp](https://github.com/iDara09/PokemonApp) is running by a REST API from https://pokeapi.co/.  
However, the API currently only has 721 Pokemons, so I start this new one which will run locally by `json` data.

## Status:
* Still in working progress.
* Have not yet to set constains.
* Storyboard is set for iPhone 6s/7.

## Preview:
Old screenshot from [PokemonApp](https://github.com/iDara09/PokemonApp). Will add new screenshots when available.
